\subsection*{4.1}
$ \kappa$ = 3.160386641199283 \\
According to the Molloy-Reed Criterion, the given graph has a giant component, as $\kappa > 2$. 

\subsection*{4.2}

Absolute size of largest component = 13478\\
Relative size of largest component = 1.0271553642973734\\

The relative size of the largest component ($\approx$ 1) confirms that the given network has a giant component.

\subsection*{4.3}
$f_c     = 0.5371198928332218$\\
\\
$f_c^{ER} = 0.5993517393065926$\\

About 54\% of the nodes need to be removed to break the network into unconnected components.\\
This network does not have enhanced robustness since $f_c < f_c^{ER}$.
